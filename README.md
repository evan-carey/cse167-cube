CSE167 Project 1 - Moving a cube in OpenGL

This project utilizes OpenGL to render a spinning cube, which can be controlled using matrix transformations.

Controls:

* t/T - Toggle the direction of the spin between clockwise and counterclockwise
* x/X - Move the cube left/right by a small amount
* y/Y - Move the cube down/up by a small amount
* z/Z - Move the cube into/out of the screen by a small amount
* r/R - Reset the cube's position, orientation, size, and color
* o/O - Orbit the cube counterclockwise/clockwise around the OpenGL window's z-axis by a small number of degrees (e.g. 10)
* s/S - Scale the cube down/up
* b/B - Switch between cube and sphere
* ESC - End program 

After each key press, the cube's position is written to the console window.
